# Neptunia Shooter
A real live working version of [Idea Factory's "Neptunia Shooter" April Fools joke](https://twitter.com/IdeaFactoryIntl/status/1112762812852428800). Use the mouse to move Neptune to avoid the dogoos while trying to last as long as you can. You have 3 lives, and can take down dogoos by firing Neptune's D-Pad hairclips at them.

All artwork (except for the dogoos) are created by Idea Factory International. This game is simply a parody and I do not own the rights to any of the Hypderdimenion Neptunia franchise.

## Main Game
`index.html` is used to run the main game. Runs in a smaller window, and is not really optimized for scale. However it runs the best.

## Wallpaper Engine Version
`wallpaperengine.html` is used for running the game through wallpaper engine. The canvas is set to 1080x1920, the default `<body>` margin is removed, the font size is increased 2x and the text at the bottom is offset by 25px so it's visible above the start bar on windows.
